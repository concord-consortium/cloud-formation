Description: ECS Web Service with load balancer and DNS Entry
Parameters:
  ShortName:
    Type: String
    Description: This is used to provide better labels for ELBTargetGroup. Unfortunately
      this can't be used for the LoadBalancer name because there isn't an easy way to
      guarantee uniqueness. It should be no more than 17 characters.
    MaxLength: '17'
  LoadBalancerIdleTimeout:
    Type: Number
    Description: how long in seconds load balancer should give idle connections.
  HealthCheckIntervalSeconds:
    Type: Number
    Description: How often in seconds to do a health check
  HealthCheckPath:
    Type: String
    Description: path on the service to check for healthiness
    Default: '/'
  HealthyThresholdCount:
    Type: Number
    Description: How many healthy health checks, before marking the task healthy.
  UnhealthyThresholdCount:
    Type: Number
    Description: How many unhealthy health checks, before marking task as unhealthy.
  HealthCheckTimeoutSeconds:
    Type: Number
    Description: How many seconds to wait for the healthcheck to return
  DeregistrationDelay:
    Type: Number
    Description: |
      The amount time for Elastic Load Balancing to wait before changing the state of a
      deregistering target from draining to unused.
  DomainName:
    Type: String
    Description: |
      the domain name to use for DNS entry for this service it must end with .concord.org
  TaskDefinition:
    Type: String
    Description: identifier for the task definition used by this service
  DesiredTaskCount:
    Type: Number
    Description: Initial number of tasks in the service
  ContainerName:
    Type: String
    Description: The name of the container in the task that the load balancer should point at
  ContainerPort:
    Type: Number
    Description: The internal port of the container that should be load balanced
    Default: '80'
  ClusterName:
    Type: String
    Description: name of cluster for the new service
  ClusterSecurityGroupId:
    Type: String
    Description: |
      the security group id of the cluster, new rule will be added to this so the load
      blancer can send requests into the cluster
  ELBScheme:
    Type: String
    Default: internet-facing
    AllowedValues: [ 'internet-facing', 'internal']
    Description: Whether this load blancer exposes the a public ip address or an internal one.
      Internal ip addresses are useful internal microservices that only need to be accessed
      within the VPC.
